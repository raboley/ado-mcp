- [ ] Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- [ ] Comment on the issue to express interest
- [ ] Discuss approach with maintainers if needed

### 9. Development Workflow
- [ ] Create a feature branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- [ ] Make your changes following the coding standards
- [ ] Write or update tests for your changes
- [ ] Run the test suite: `task test`
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass

### 10. Code Quality Checks
- [ ] Format code: `task format`
- [ ] Run linting: `task lint`  
- [ ] Check type hints: `task typecheck` (if available)
- [ ] Verify no security issues in dependencies
- [ ] Add docstrings for new public functions

### 11. Testing Your Changes
- [ ] Run specific tests related to your changes:
  ```bash
  task test-single TEST_NAME=tests/path/to/your/test.py
  ```
- [ ] Test manually if applicable:
  ```bash
  task dev  # Start development server
  ```
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for user-facing features
- [ ] Verify your changes don't break existing functionality

### 12. Documentation
- [ ] Update relevant documentation if your changes affect:
  - [ ] API functionality
  - [ ] Installation process
  - [ ] Configuration options
  - [ ] User workflows
- [ ] Add code comments for complex logic

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Environment Issues
- **Tests failing locally**: 
  - Ensure `task ado-up` completed successfully
  - Check that all required environment variables are set
  - Verify your PAT has correct permissions

- **Import errors**:
  - Run `task install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
  - Check that you're using the correct Python version

### Development Issues  
- **Terraform errors**:
  - Check your Azure DevOps organization URL is correct
  - Ensure your PAT token hasn't expired
  - Try `task ado-down` then `task ado-up` to recreate environment

- **Test timeouts**:
  - The test suite uses a 300-second timeout for long operations
  - Some tests require network connectivity to Azure DevOps
  - Use `task test-sequential` for debugging individual test failures  

### Code Quality Issues
- **Linting failures**:
  - Run `task format` to auto-fix formatting issues
  - Check `pyproject.toml` for project-specific style rules
  - Install recommended VS Code extensions for automatic formatting

- **Type checking errors**:
  - Add proper type hints to new functions
  - Import types from `typing` module when needed
  - Use Pydantic models for data structures

## Getting Help

### Resources
- [ ] **Documentation**: Start with `docs/` directory
- [ ] **Code Examples**: Review existing similar implementations
- [ ] **Tests**: Check test files for usage patterns
- [ ] **Issues**: Search existing issues for similar problems

### Asking for Help
- [ ] Search existing issues and discussions first
- [ ] Provide complete error messages and stack traces
- [ ] Include your environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)
- [ ] Share minimal reproducible examples
- [ ] Be specific about what you expected vs. what happened

### Community
- [ ] **GitHub Discussions**: For design questions and ideas
- [ ] **Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests  
- [ ] **Pull Requests**: For code review and implementation discussion
- [ ] **Security Issues**: Use GitHub Security Advisories for vulnerabilities
