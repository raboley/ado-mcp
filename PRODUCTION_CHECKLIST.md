# Production Readiness Checklist for ADO-MCP

This checklist outlines features needed to make ado-mcp production-ready, based on analysis of Azure MCP and best practices.

## ‚úÖ Already Implemented
- [x] Basic authentication (PAT, Azure CLI)
- [x] Comprehensive caching layer
- [x] End-to-end testing
- [x] PyPI distribution
- [x] Basic error handling
- [x] Logging infrastructure
- [x] Azure Pipelines CI

## üî¥ High Priority (Security & Reliability)

### Authentication & Security
- [ ] Implement credential chaining with fallback
  - [ ] Environment ‚Üí Azure CLI ‚Üí Interactive Browser
  - [ ] Service Principal support
  - [ ] Managed Identity support (for Azure-hosted scenarios)
- [ ] Add token caching with secure storage
- [ ] Implement authentication timeout handling
- [ ] Add support for conditional access policies

### Resilience & Error Handling
- [ ] Add retry policies with exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement rate limiting handling (429 errors)
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Create structured error types with error codes
- [ ] Enhanced validation framework

### Observability
- [ ] Enable OpenTelemetry for production use
- [ ] Add metrics collection (latency, error rates, API usage)
- [ ] Implement correlation IDs for request tracking
- [ ] Add structured logging with context
- [ ] Create health check endpoint

## üü° Medium Priority (Operations & Maintenance)

### Configuration Management
- [ ] Create configuration classes (replace env vars)
- [ ] Add configuration validation
- [ ] Support for config files (YAML/JSON)
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations

### Documentation
- [ ] Create authentication guide
- [ ] Add troubleshooting documentation
- [ ] Write enterprise deployment guide
- [ ] Document network/firewall requirements
- [ ] Add migration guide from other tools

### CI/CD Enhancements
- [ ] Add security scanning (Bandit, Safety)
- [ ] Implement multi-stage release pipeline
- [ ] Add integration test environment
- [ ] Create release notes automation
- [ ] Add code signing for packages

## üü¢ Lower Priority (Nice to Have)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Broker authentication (Windows Hello)
- [ ] Multiple server modes (namespace filtering)
- [ ] Offline mode with cached data
- [ ] Plugin architecture for extensions
- [ ] CLI configuration wizard

### Performance
- [ ] Connection pooling optimization
- [ ] Async/await for all API calls
- [ ] Batch operation support
- [ ] Response streaming for large data

## üìä Implementation Priority Matrix

| Feature | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| Credential Chaining | High | Medium | P0 |
| Retry Policies | High | Low | P0 |
| Production Telemetry | High | Medium | P0 |
| Token Caching | Medium | Low | P1 |
| Structured Config | Medium | Medium | P1 |
| Security Scanning | Medium | Low | P1 |
| Service Principal | High | Medium | P1 |
| Documentation | Medium | Medium | P2 |

## üöÄ Quick Wins (Can implement immediately)
1. Add retry policies with exponential backoff
2. Enable production telemetry
3. Add security scanning to CI pipeline
4. Create structured error types
5. Add configuration classes

## üìù Notes
- Focus on backward compatibility when adding features
- Maintain the "no mocking" test philosophy
- Keep authentication methods extensible
- Consider enterprise proxy scenarios
- Plan for air-gapped environments
