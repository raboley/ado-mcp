# Project Basics

# Contribution Requirements

* Always include a new end to end black box test for each feature
* Only use mocks in tests to simulate failure cases for external dependencies we do not control.
* Ensure code coverage is 100%
* Always add log statements with clear error message and execution context for situations that may go wrong.
* Always Include a doc comment for package functions using the google style.
